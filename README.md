This must be using cmd to open. First you go to terminal, and use cd to get to where you accessed the project. Then use "javac TicTacToeServer.java" to compile the program.
Next, do "java TicTacToeServer.java localhost". This will activate the server portion.
For the client, open another cmd terminal, and cd to get to the folder where you put this program. Then use "javac TicTacToeClient.java" to compile the program.
Next do "java TicTacToeClient.java localhost", which will activate the first client. Repeat for second client to start playing.
